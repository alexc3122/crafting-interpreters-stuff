# Challenge #3 from Chapter 1

This is a basic implementation of a doubly-linked list of heap-allocated strings. 

Things to note:
* Some of my comments, particuarly on setting pointers, are VERY verbose. That's an artifact of me thinking and writing out what I needed to do.
* There is no `list_update()` function defined.
